## Add Devise!

### Step 1

Add the User model to your application using Devise

### Step 2

Use Devise to create the views for logging in and signing up. Pay attention to the routes that Devise generates for you.

### Step 3

Once you can successfully sign up and log in, add login/logout links. (Hint: Devise provides some helpers to use in your views and controllers. Use them!)

### Step 4

Prevent users from creating, editing, and deleting tshirts unless they are signed in.

### Step 5

If a user is not logged in, she can still view all tshirts and individual tshirts.
